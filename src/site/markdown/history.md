# Some Historical Background

Some years  ago I decided to  do more with Java.  I've written lot of  tools and
programs for learning. Most  of them not notable. But I've  realized fast that I
do lot  of copy and  pasting. Almost always some  boiler plate code.  Things you
need every time. The big disadvantage of copy  paste is that if you fix a bug or
improve the code, you have to paste it  to all the copies. You know the problem.
So I decided to share this common  code over my small projects. The simplest way
for me  was to make a  Maven dependency. Because  I always run my  projects with
Maven.
